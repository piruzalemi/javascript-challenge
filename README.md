# javascript-challenge
Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, this Alemi repository appends a table to my web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

# Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

I made sure I have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

Used a date form in my HTML document and wrote an Alemi JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match any users input.

# Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

In part II. 

I Used multiple input tags and/or select dropdowns. I wrote JavaScript code so the user can set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

date/time
city
state
country
shape
